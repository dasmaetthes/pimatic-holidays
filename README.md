pimatic-holidays
======================

This Pimatic plugin provides a device and also a variable that
shows if the current day is a holiday or not.

I was missing this information as i do not want to get woken up on a public holiday. :)
So i thought why not trying to write a plugin for it.

It's using "date-holiday" to get the information.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-holidays

Set country and state variables according to the list on date-holiday's site...


As its my first step into coffescript and writing pimatic-plugins it still has lots of errors.
But anyway, so far it seems to work and i'm trying to fix the issues...
